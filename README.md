# In-progress
"In progress" is a team participating in Startify7 Summer Academy 2016 in Almeria, Spain, working on the potential of virtual and augmented reality. Our project aims to use a mix of AR/VR to produce social impact in the humanitarian field by providing a tool for Not-for-Profit Organizations helping displaced refugees. Through our project we want to raise awareness in the life and needs of people living in refugee camps and enable users to place their donations in a collaborative platform of NPOs

## Why 
The added value of this project lies in the fact that we use applied immersive teachnologies in a field that has been using more traditional Communication channels so far. By implementing Our project in the form of an mobile spp, our main objective is to provide NPOs a new way of engaging potential donors thereby increasing donations rates. At the same time, we are including additional premium features which will provide user targeting and direct Communication between users and NPOs
